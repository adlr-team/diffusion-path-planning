# Implementation Notes
- This is based on the maze2d branch from Janner
- I added  device = "cpu" to the config.py file, line 24 and 67. Fix them when you want CUDA
- In Maze2D branch, the temporal.py and helpers.py are the same as the main branch, but the diffusion.py is slightly different, so I  creating a new Maze2D folder (not a branch) to test it out. training.py is different. 
-In the script folder, planmaze2d and train are relevant for us.
-setup.py has the Parser.
-Take arguments from config/maze2d.py without using the Parser
-Comment out gym in preprocessing.py
-Comment out d4rl and 23-25 and import gym at datasets/d4rl.py --> convert everthing to "import gymnasium as gym"
-diffuser_test_new has the new gym robotics environment, diffuser_test_new_wo_gym is the last working version that does not have gym. (pip install gymnasium-robotics)
- import gymnasium as gym (did not work on Windows) (Could not build wheels for mujoco, which is required to install pyproject.toml-based projects)
- Switched to Colab
- pip install mujoco and gymnasium
- arrays.py update the device: DEVICE = 'cuda:0' to DEVICE = 'cpu' for now
- Comment out #import mujoco_py as mjc in rendering.py! Do not install mujoco-py (a different thing from mujoco)
- Get rid of d4rl too (d4rl.py line 23-25 comment out)
- Changing the environment requires properties to be changed too. I get 'PointMazeEnv' object has no attribute 'maze_arr' and similar errors and they need to be modified according to the new library.
- I commented out the MujocoRenderer class inside rendering.py because we do not use it and it uses the old mujoco binding (mujoco-py)
